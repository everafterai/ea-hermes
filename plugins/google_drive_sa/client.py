"""Google Drive client backed by a service account via ADC.

Credential resolution mirrors the Google Chat adapter
(``plugins/platforms/google_chat/adapter.py``) so the gateway can run on a
GCP VM / Cloud Run with an *attached* service account and zero key files:

  1. Explicit ``GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`` env (path or inline JSON)
  2. ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` env (path)
  3. Application Default Credentials via ``google.auth.default()`` — picks up
     the VM's workload identity automatically (the everafter-deployed path),
     or ``gcloud auth application-default login`` locally.

The agent acts as the *service account itself* (no domain-wide delegation):
share Drive files/folders with the SA's email to grant access. This keeps the
blast radius to exactly what's shared.

Heavy google-* imports are lazy so the plugin can register its tools at
startup without the deps installed; first real use triggers a venv-scoped
install via :mod:`tools.lazy_deps`.

The built ``googleapiclient`` service wraps an ``httplib2.Http`` transport
that is NOT thread-safe, but ``plugins/google_drive_sa/access.py::filter_listing``
fans ACL fetches out over a thread pool (and two concurrent gateway turns can
call in on the same process besides). Credentials are safe to share across
threads, so they're cached process-wide; the *service* objects are cached
per-thread (``threading.local()``) so each worker thread gets its own
transport instead of racing on one.
